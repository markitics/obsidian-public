I just had a delicious meal.

Swapped a few WhatsApp messages with Duffy earlier. Told him I had started trying Obsidian yesterday; he said the same to me!

I should book my flights for London this weekend â€” will probably fly via Dublin airport; should be fun!

Oh, so this is awesome; Obsidian has vim mode! 

First impression: This *would* be awesome on my iPad except that my smart folio keyboard has no Escape button, and I donâ€™t know how to do key bindings! Nonetheless, it should be fun on the Mac! 

Second impression: Wait, I *can* have an escape key! And Iâ€™d wanted to remap CAPS LOCK to Escape anyway â†’ turns out [itâ€™s possible](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-add-escape-key-to-ipad-external-keyboard/) in 
`Settings â†’ Keyboard â†’ Hardware Keyboard â†’ Modifier Keys`  ðŸ™Œ

Whatâ€™s the best place to store images (like the screenshot above)? Beside the file? Probably makes the most sense from the POV of owning my data in a manageable way.
