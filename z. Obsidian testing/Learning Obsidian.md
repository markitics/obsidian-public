Well, I've used Notion a lot over the last few years. Then I enjoyed using Subconscious ([[Gordon Brander]]) yesterday. 

But now I'm trying Obsidian… wow I love it!

To encourage me to write more, it's probably the best. 

I'll also add a note for [[Mark Moriarty]] and I'll check in the file explorer if that auto-created a note. It seems it did NOT, until I click that for the first time. 

So far… Subconscious just seems like a simplified alternative to Obsidian, with fewer features, a more uncertain future (less support), and less documentation.
