# Adding a README for github.

Idea: share some files to a public github, so I have time-stamped papertrail of what I wrote when; and if I go back and edit an evergreen post, you can inspect the changelog/diff in the repo to view the specific updates over time. 

Let's see if this works, and let's see if it's remotely useful.
